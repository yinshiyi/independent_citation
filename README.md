first use the submodule to generate the links

then use the bash script to get the numbers

# background

for US immigration, most law firm will ask independent citations numbers, not the google scholar numbers. 
there are two types of definations of self-citation (none independent citation), how to count is still an active area of debate.

1. the paper citing my paper cannot have my name on it, excluding self-citation by me, (author centric model) 
Kacem, A., Flatt, J.W. & Mayr, P. Tracking self-citations in academic publishing. Scientometrics 123, 1157â€“1165 (2020). https://doi.org/10.1007/s11192-020-03413-9 

2. the paper citing my paper cannot have any overlap of any names, excluding self-citation by me and co-authors, (article centric model)
Ioannidis, J. P. A., Baas, J., Klavans, R., & Boyack, K. W. (2019). A standardized citation metrics author database annotated for scientific field. PLoS Biology,17(8), e3000384. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3000384.

In my expereinces, as of 2023, most will either ask for 200 citation for EB1B or ask for 150 independent (type 2) for EB1B.
